Description: Rasterize images using a 3D software renderer. 3D scenes are created either by importing external files, building scenes out of the included objects, or by constructing meshes manually. Supports point and directional lights, anti-aliased lines, shadow mapping, transparent objects, translucent objects, multiple materials types, reflection, refraction, environment maps, multicore rendering, bloom, tone-mapping, and screen-space ambient occlusion.
