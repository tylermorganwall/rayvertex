Description: 3D software renderer that uses the rasterization algorithm to generate images. 3D scenes are specified entirely in R, and can be built either by importing external files, building scenes out of the included objects, or by constructing meshes manually. Supports point lights and directional lights, anti-aliased lines, shadow mapping, transparent objects, translucent objects, multiple materials types (vertex, diffuse, phong, toon, flat), reflection, refraction, environment maps, multicore rendering, bloom, tone-mapping, and screen-space ambient occlusion.
